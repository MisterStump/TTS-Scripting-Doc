The in-game editor will continue to exist for quick access to scripts, but development on it will cease to continue.\n\n\nPrefer another text editor? Take look at our \nExternal Editor API\n to make your own plugin.\n\n\nFeatures\n\u00b6\n\n\nThis is only a summarized list of features Atom offers. Check out a more complete documentation on the plugin specifically in the \nplugin wiki\n.\n\n\nSyntax Highlighting\n\u00b6\n\n\nAll standard Lua syntax is highlighted in multiple colors to help with readability.\n\n\n\n\nCode Autocompletion\n\u00b6\n\n\nThe entire Tabletop Simulator Lua Scripting API (with the exception of the Player class) has been added to the native Atom autocomplete system. Easily see all of the member variables and functions available to you with their parameters, return type, short description, and a link directly to our Knowledge Base with more information for that variable or function. Functions belonging to the Lua standard library classes such as math, coroutine, or os link directly to the official Lua documentation.\n\n\n\n\nTabletop Simulator Interactivity\n\u00b6\n\n\nThe Atom plugin can directly connect to a running instance of Tabletop Simulator to get all of the existing Lua scripts on Objects and to call Save & Play. Both functions can be called directly from the Packages menu or the right click contextual menu. TTS must be running with the game loaded for these functions to work.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommand\n\n\nAction Taken\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet Lua Scripts\n\n\nDownloads all existing scripts in a loaded Tabletop Simulator game with Atom. You will need to call Get Lua Scripts every time you change to a different game in TTS.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSave & Play\n\n\nSaves all Lua files in Atom, uploads them to a loaded Tabletop Simulator game, and reloads the current game (same as Save & Play in the in-game editor).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvery time you start up Atom, the cached local *.lua files are deleted.\n\n\n\n\nInstalling Atom\n\u00b6\n\n\nDownload and install Atom \nfrom the official website\n.\n\n\nInstalling the Official Plugin\n\u00b6\n\n\n\n\nClick on File -> Settings\n\n\nSelect the Install tab in Settings\n\n\nType in tabletopsimulator-lua into the search field and press the Enter key or click the Packages button\n\n\nClick the blue Install button for the tabletopsimulator-lua package\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSetting Up Atom\n\u00b6\n\n\nTab Width\n\u00b6\n\n\nBy default, Tabletop Simulator scripts use a tab width of four spaces.

To optionally make Atom default to a tab width of four spaces:\n\n\n\n\nClick on File -> Settings\n\n\nSelect the Settings tab in Settings\n\n\nScroll down to Tab Length\n\n\nSet the Tab Length to 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTabls as Pipe Operators\n\u00b6\n\n\nTo enable tabs showing up as pipe operators \"|\" as an indent guide:\n\n\n\n\nClick on File -> Settings\n\n\nSelect the Settings tab in Settings\n\n\nScroll down to Show Indent Guide\n\n\nCheck Show Indent Guide\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdating Atom Plugin\n\u00b6\n\n\nThe plugin will automatically check for updates when Atom is started. If a new update is found, it will update itself. You will have to manually restart Atom for the new version of the plugin to be loaded. You can check Atom's console if it found an update (ctrl + alt + i).\n\n\nAtom Tips\n\u00b6\n\n\nThese are just a few basic tips to help get the most out of Atom.\n\n\n\n\nPrint Messages\n\n\nAll print() functions automatically send their messages to Atom's console (ctrl + alt + i).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nError Messages\n\n\nAll Lua errors are automatically sent to Atom's console (ctrl + alt + i).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuick Save + Play\n\n\nHitting Ctrl + Shift + S will trigger Save & Play.",

Scripted inputs are boxes you can click inside of in-game to input/edit text. Every letter typed triggers the function. The bool that is returned as part of the input_function allows you to determine when a player has finished editing the input.\n\n\nInput Tips\nInputs can not be clicked from their back side.\nInputs can not be clicked if there is another object between the pointer and the inputs. This does not include the Object the input is attached to.\nInputs are placed relative to the Object they are attached to.\nThe maximum font size is capped at 1000.\nThe minimum width/height is 60. Any lower number (besides 0) will appear to be 60. This prevents visual glitches involving the corner rounding.\nFont that does not fit in the input window's width/height does NOT display. To know how much height you need for each line, the formula is \n(font_size * # of lines) + 23\n. In other words, multiply how many lines of text you want to display by your font_size and add 23.

This is because only once two items try to exist at the same time is one of them given a new GUID, and Objects in a container do not currently exist. Removing all Objects from the container at once will force all of them to be given unique GUIDs.\nTip for using index to pull Object\nWhen you take an Object from the container, all higher indexes are reduced by 1 instantly. If you pull more than once Object at once by their index, you must account for this index changing.",

This is because only once two items try to exist at the same time is one of them given a new GUID, and Objects in a container do not currently exist. Removing all Objects from the container at once will force all of them to be given unique GUIDs. Tip for using index to pull Object When you take an Object from the container, all higher indexes are reduced by 1 instantly. If you pull more than once Object at once by their index, you must account for this index changing.",
