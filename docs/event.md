Events are functions which are activated by Tabletop Simulator when something takes place in-game. It is possible to use all of them within scripts on Objects, and most will also work in Global scripts.

##Function Summary

##Function Details (Global & Object)

###onChat(...)

This function is called when a message is sent through the in-game chat. It does not trigger when global chat messages are sent. Using `#!lua return false` inside of this function prevents the chat message which triggered it to be supressed.

!!!info "onChat(String message, Player)""
	* **String message**: A String containing the chat message which triggered the function.
	* **Player**: A reference to the Player which sent the chat message.

``` Lua
function onChat(message, player)
	print(message)
	print(player.color)
end
```

---


###onExternalMessage(...)

This function is called when an external script editor (like [Atom](atom)) sends a message back to the game. Used for custom editor functionality.

!!!info "onExternalMessage(Table)"
	* **Table**: The data returned by the external editor into the game.

``` Lua
function onExternalMessage(data)
	print("External message received")
end
```

---


###onFixedUpdate()

Called **every physics tick** (90 times a second). This is a frame independent onUpdate(). | [<i class="material-icons" style="line-height:150%;">info_outline</i>](#onfixedupdate)

!!!warning
	This is a very expensive function and can easily slow/crash your game if missused. Use with caution.

``` Lua
function onFixedUpdate()
	self.addTorque({0,100,0}, 1)
end
```


###onLoad(...)

This function is called when a game save is finished loading every Object. This is where most setup code will go. The fast-forward and rewind feature will also cause this function to activate. If this function is in an Object's script and that Object is spawned, like by removing it from a container, it too will trigger onLoad().

!!!info "onLoad(String save_state)"
	* **String save_state**: The encoded string containing any save_state (saved) data.
		* {>>If there is no data saved, this returns an empty String.<<}

``` Lua
function onLoad()
	print("Loading complete")
end
```

???example "Example of onLoad and onSave being used to save/load data"
    ``` Lua
	--Runs whenever game is saved/autosaved
	function onSave()
		local data_to_save = {someData=50}
		saved_data = JSON.encode(data_to_save)
		--saved_data = "" --Remove -- at start & save to clear save data
		return saved_data
	end

	--Runs when game is loaded
	function onLoad(saved_data)
		--Loads the tracking for if the game has started yet
		if saved_data ~= "" then
			local loaded_data = JSON.decode(saved_data)
			someData = loaded_data.someData
		else
			someData = 50
		end
	end
    ```
---


###onObjectDestroy(...)

---


###onSave()

Called whenever your game is saved, either manually or by auto-save. It is used to allow information to persist through saving/loading. It allows you to place information into a table that is written into the save file. It works on Global information and can also be used to save information onto an Object.

!!!important
	When using `onSave()`, information is saved into the save file you are using. Using *Save & Apply* does NOT cause it to record data, only overwriting your save will update what information `onSave()` is trying to record.

!!!warning
	You can save almost any data in a table using this function, but Object references **DO NOT** persist. If you need to record an Object using `onSave()`, record its GUID instead.

``` Lua
data_table = {answer=42}

function onSave()
	saved_data = JSON.encode(data_table)
	self.script_state = saved_data
end
```

Check the [`onLoad()`](#onload) section for how to load the information you record into your save file.

---


###onScriptingButtonDown(...)

	* **Int index**: An Int for the index number, representing which key was pressed.
	* **String player_color**: A String of the color of the player who triggered the function.

``` Lua
function onScriptingButtonDown(index, color)
	print(index)
end
```

---

###onScriptingButtonUp(...)

Called when a scripting button (numpad by default) is released. The index range that is returned is 1-10.

!!!info "onScriptingButtonUp(Int index, String player_color)"
	* **Int index**: An Int for the index number, representing which key was released.
	* **String player_color**: A String of the color of the player who triggered the function.

``` Lua
function onScriptingButtonUp(index, color)
	print(index)
end
```

---


###onUpdate()

Called **every frame**.

!!!warning
	This is a very expensive function and can easily slow/crash your game if missused. Use with caution.

``` Lua
function onUpdate()
	print("This will probably slow your game down."
end
```
